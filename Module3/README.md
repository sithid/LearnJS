# Module 3: Modern JavaScript

## Overview
This module covers modern JavaScript features and practices, focusing on ES6+ syntax, asynchronous programming, and modular code organization. Each lesson includes practical exercises, test suites, and real-world applications.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this module, you will:
- Master ES6+ features
- Handle asynchronous operations
- Implement modular code design
- Use modern JavaScript patterns
- Test async code
- Apply modern best practices

## Lessons

### Lesson 1: ES6+ Features
- Arrow functions
- Template literals
- Destructuring
- Spread/rest operators
- Classes and inheritance
- Testing modern syntax

### Lesson 2: Promises and Async
- Promises
- Async/await
- Error handling
- API integration
- Testing async code

### Lesson 3: Modules
- Module syntax
- Import/export
- Code organization
- Dependency management
- Testing modules

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to each lesson directory
2. Read the lesson README
3. Complete the exercises
4. Run the tests
5. Check solutions if needed

## Testing Your Code

Each lesson includes a modern test suite:
1. Open the lesson's `test.html` in your browser
2. Write code using modern syntax
3. Tests run automatically
4. Debug async operations
5. Verify all tests pass
