# Lesson 2: Promises and Async/Await

## Overview
This lesson covers asynchronous programming in JavaScript using Promises and async/await syntax. You'll learn how to handle asynchronous operations, manage errors, and implement common patterns for concurrent programming.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this lesson, you will:
- Understand Promise creation and usage
- Master Promise chaining and error handling
- Implement retry mechanisms and timeouts
- Use async/await for cleaner async code
- Handle concurrent operations
- Implement real-world async patterns
- Apply best practices for async programming

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Lesson 1: ES6+ Features
- Understanding of callbacks and asynchronous concepts
- Basic error handling knowledge
- Familiarity with HTTP requests

## Exercises

### 1. Basic Promise Creation
Create a promise that resolves with a value after a specified delay.

### 2. Promise Chaining
Implement a function that chains multiple promises to process user data sequentially.

### 3. Promise Error Handling
Create a retry mechanism for failed HTTP requests using promises.

### 4. Promise.all Usage
Implement parallel data fetching for multiple users using Promise.all.

### 5. Promise.race Implementation
Create a timeout mechanism for fetch requests using Promise.race.

### 6. Async/Await Basics
Refactor promise-based code to use async/await syntax.

### 7. Async Error Handling
Implement robust error handling with retry logic using async/await.

### 8. Parallel Processing
Process multiple async tasks concurrently while handling errors.

### 9. Sequential Processing
Execute async tasks in sequence where each task depends on the previous result.

### 10. Real-world Example
Implement a caching mechanism for async data fetching.

## Getting Started

1. Open `exercises.js` in your editor
2. Implement each exercise following the TODO comments
3. Run `test.html` in your browser to check your solutions
4. Use `solutions.js` for reference if needed

## Testing
Open `test.html` in your browser to run the test suite. Each test will show:
- ✓ Green check for passing tests
- ✗ Red X for failing tests
- Error messages for failed tests

## Tips
- Always handle both success and error cases
- Use try/catch blocks with async/await
- Consider edge cases in async operations
- Implement proper error messages
- Use appropriate timeout values
- Consider performance implications
- Test with slow network conditions

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to handle errors
- Not implementing proper timeouts
- Blocking the main thread
- Race conditions in concurrent operations
- Memory leaks in event listeners
- Callback hell even with promises
- Not cleaning up resources
