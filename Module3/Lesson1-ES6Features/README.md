# Lesson 1: ES6+ Features

## Overview
This lesson covers modern JavaScript features introduced in ES6 and later versions. You'll learn about arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, classes, and other essential modern JavaScript features.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this lesson, you will:
- Master arrow functions and lexical scope
- Use template literals for string interpolation
- Apply destructuring for cleaner code
- Implement spread/rest operators
- Create and use ES6 classes
- Work with Map and Set data structures
- Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing
- Apply modern JavaScript best practices

## Prerequisites
- Basic JavaScript knowledge
- Understanding of functions and objects
- Familiarity with arrays and loops

## Exercises

### 1. Arrow Functions and Lexical Scope
Create a counter object with increment, decrement, and getCount methods using arrow functions and closure.

### 2. Template Literals
Format user information using template literals for cleaner string interpolation.

### 3. Destructuring
Extract specific properties from objects using destructuring assignment.

### 4. Spread/Rest Operators
Combine multiple arrays using the spread operator and rest parameters.

### 5. Classes
Implement a Shape class with methods for calculating area and perimeter.

### 6. Map and Set
Create functions to remove duplicates using Set and implement a phone book using Map.

### 7. Optional Chaining and Nullish Coalescing
Safely access nested object properties and provide default values.

### 8. Enhanced Object Literals
Create objects using modern object literal syntax.

### 9. Default Parameters
Implement a greeting function with default parameters.

### 10. Array Methods
Process arrays using modern array methods (map, filter, reduce).

## Getting Started

1. Open `exercises.js` in your editor
2. Implement each exercise following the TODO comments
3. Run `test.html` in your browser to check your solutions
4. Use `solutions.js` for reference if needed

## Testing
Open `test.html` in your browser to run the test suite. Each test will show:
- ✓ Green check for passing tests
- ✗ Red X for failing tests
- Error messages for failed tests

## Tips
- Use modern syntax whenever possible
- Pay attention to lexical scope with arrow functions
- Consider edge cases in your implementations
- Use the browser console for debugging
- Read error messages carefully
