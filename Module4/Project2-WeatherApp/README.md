# Project 2: Weather App

## Project Overview
Build a weather application that fetches and displays weather data from a weather API. The app will show current weather conditions, forecasts, and allow users to search for different locations. It will demonstrate working with APIs, async/await, and dynamic UI updates.

## API Setup
### Getting an API Key
1. Sign up for a free account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Go to your account's "API Keys" section
3. Generate a new API key (it may take a few hours to activate)

### Configuring the API Key
1. Create a file `js/config.js` in your project:
   ```javascript
   export const WEATHER_API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here';
   ```
2. Add this file to your `.gitignore` to keep your API key private:
   ```
   # .gitignore
   js/config.js
   ```

### API Usage Guidelines
- Free tier limitations:
  - 60 calls/minute
  - Current weather and 5-day forecast data
  - Basic weather maps
- The app implements rate limiting to stay within these limits
- Consider implementing caching to reduce API calls

### Security Best Practices
- Never commit your API key to version control
- Don't expose the key in client-side code in production
- Consider using environment variables in production
- Use a backend proxy for production deployments

### Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions:
1. "API key is invalid":
   - Verify the key is correctly copied
   - Wait a few hours after creating a new key
   - Check for any spaces or special characters

2. "Too many requests":
   - Implement proper rate limiting
   - Use caching for repeated requests
   - Check your API usage in the OpenWeatherMap dashboard

3. "Failed to fetch":
   - Verify your internet connection
   - Check if the API endpoint is correct
   - Ensure your API key has the correct permissions

## Requirements

### Core Features
1. Weather Data Display
   - Current temperature and conditions
   - High and low temperatures
   - Humidity and wind speed
   - Weather icon and description
   - 5-day forecast

2. Location Management

   - Animated weather icons
   - Temperature unit conversion (CÂ°/FÂ°)
   - Responsive design for all devices
   - Loading states and transitions

2. Data Visualization
   - Temperature graphs
   - Precipitation probability
   - Wind direction indicator
   - UV index display

3. Advanced Features
