# Module 4: JavaScript Projects

## Overview
In this module, you'll apply everything you've learned in the previous modules to build three complete projects. Each project will help you practice different aspects of JavaScript programming and reinforce your understanding of core concepts.

## Projects

### Project 1: Interactive Todo List
Build a fully functional todo list application that demonstrates:
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Local storage
- Form validation
- Filtering and sorting

### Project 2: Weather App
Create a weather application that showcases:
- Async/await
- API integration

### Project 3: Quiz Application
Develop a quiz application that implements:
- Object-oriented programming
- Module pattern
- State management
- Timer functionality
- Score tracking

## Learning Objectives
By completing these projects, you will:
- Apply JavaScript concepts in real-world scenarios
- Practice problem-solving and debugging
- Learn project organization and code structure
- Understand user interface design
- Implement common web application features

## Getting Started
1. Each project has its own directory with:
   - Project requirements
   - Starter files
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Testing guidelines
2. Complete the projects in order
3. Test thoroughly before moving to the next project
4. Review and refactor your code
