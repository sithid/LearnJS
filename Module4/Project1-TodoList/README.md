# Project 1: Interactive Todo List

## Project Overview
Build a fully functional todo list application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. The application will use local storage to persist data and include features like filtering, sorting, and form validation.

## Requirements

### Core Features
1. Task Management
   - Add new tasks with title, description, due date, and priority
   - Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
   - Edit existing tasks
   - Delete tasks
   - Bulk actions (delete completed, mark all as complete)

2. Data Persistence
   - Save tasks to local storage
   - Load tasks from local storage on page load
   - Auto-save when tasks are modified

3. User Interface
   - Clean, responsive design
   - Visual feedback for actions
   - Loading states
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### Additional Features
1. Filtering
   - Filter by status (all, active, completed)
   - Filter by priority
   - Search by task title/description

2. Sorting
   - Sort by due date
   - Sort by priority
   - Sort by completion status

3. Form Validation
   - Required fields validation
   - Date format validation
   - Input sanitization
